# Project 2 - *ios101-project2-wordle-starter*

Submitted by: **Gerald Shimo**

**Worlde** is an app that lets users play a customizable version of Wordle. Players can adjust how many letters are in the goal word, how many guesses they get, and even change the theme of the words. There’s also an “Alien Wordle” mode where the goal word changes after every guess!

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User can change the number of letters per row (the length of the goal word)
- [x] User can change the numbers of rows on the board (how many guesses allowed)
- [x] User can select a new themed set to pull the goal word from
- [x] User can select "alien wordle", causing the goal word to change after each guess


The following **optional** features are implemented:

## Notes

Correctly casting values from [String: Any] to Int, Bool, or custom WordTheme.
Understanding delegation between SettingsViewController and ViewController.
Implementing the “Alien Wordle” mode so that the goal word regenerates at the right time.
